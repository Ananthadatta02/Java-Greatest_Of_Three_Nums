# Java-Greatest_Of_Three_Nums
This Java program takes three integer inputs from the user and determines the greatest among them using conditional statements. It uses a Scanner for input and compares the numbers using if-else logic. The program then prints the greatest number to the console. Simple and efficient decision-making logic.
